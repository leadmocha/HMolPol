Purpose:

This is just and introduction to the general layout of a GDML document.

-------------------------------------------

A GDML is based off of the XML language.  It is developed for use in GEANT4.
A good starting website is http://gdml.web.cern.ch/GDML/

The document will start with the XML Declaration:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

This will be followed by defining the following:
  - GDML namespace:  xmlns:gdml="http://cern.ch/2001/Schemas/GDML"
  - XML Schema Instance namespace: xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  - GDML Schema location: xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="schema/gdml.xsd"
This will be done by using the following few lines:
    <gdml xmlns:gdml="http://cern.ch/2001/Schemas/GDML"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="schema/gdml.xsd">
      
Next is the declaration of the constants, positions, rotations, scaling, 
variables, quantities, and matrices.
    <define>
     ...
    </define>
    
Followed by the materials.  Materials can be elements, materials, isotopes,
mixtures, etc.  Materials will only be referenced by solids
    <materials>
     ...
    </materials>
    
Then define all the solids that will be used in THIS geometry file.  These 
solids can be boxes, tubs, cones, etc.
    <solids>
     ...
    </solids>
    
The final section is the structure section.  This is where one places the 
volumes, defines there material.  Physical volumes are placed in logical volumes with specific 
positions, rotations, and scales.  
    <structure>
    ...
    </structure>

Specify the top volume
    <setup name="">
     ...
    </setup>
    
End the file by closing out the gdml part by
    </gdml>
